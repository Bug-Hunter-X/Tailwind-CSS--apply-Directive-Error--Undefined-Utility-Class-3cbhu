The solution depends on the root cause.  If the class is misspelled, correct the spelling. If the class doesn't exist, there are two ways to resolve it:

1. **Add the class to your Tailwind configuration:** If you intend to use `bg-blue-500`, ensure it's included in your `tailwind.config.js` file's `theme` section (or equivalent). 

2. **Remove the `@apply` directive:** If the class isn't needed, simply remove the `@apply bg-blue-500` part.

```html
<div class="bg-red-700 bg-blue-500"></div>  <!-- Corrected: Direct class application -->
```
